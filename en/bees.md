# Bees 🐝

You may ask, “Why the name ’code hive‘?” Among many reasons:

1. Bees are amazing creatures,
and although some of them make honey (as _Apis mellifera_ and others) but also as
an important pollinator. *Save the bees!*

2. Bees are hard working creatures. Here at Code Hive Tx, LLC, we aim to work hard
on your project!

3. The hexagonal honeycomb ⬡ is [97% optimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeycomb#Geometry)
in terms of volume to surface area.

We’ve curated some [bee pictures](https://unsplash.com/collections/aT3yHhUkxYk/abejas), which make great
backgrounds.

## By the way

Sorry, we don’t have honey, bees, or hives for sale— but the
Texas Beekeepers Association can help you find
[Texas honey](https://texasbeekeepers.org/honey-locator/) or
other information.
