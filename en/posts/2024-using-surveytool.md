As part of our work with the [CLDR Digitally Disadvantaged Languages (DDL)](https://cldr.unicode.org/ddl) workgroup, we created a training video for the Survey Tool. Enjoy!

The Survey Tool has opened for data submission for version 46.
If you would like to contribute content for your language, take a look at [cldr.unicode.org](https://cldr.unicode.org/#h.vw32p8sealpj) to get started.

We're adding English subtitles and investigating a workflow for translating them as well.  That might be the subject of a separate blog post.
