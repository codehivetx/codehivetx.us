    <h1>Bees 🐝</h1>

    <p>
      You may ask, “Why the name ’code hive‘?” Among many reasons:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Bees are amazing creatures,
        and although some of them make honey (as <i>Apis mellifera</i> and others) but also as
        an important pollinator. <b>Save the bees!</b>
      </li>
      <li>Bees are hard working creatures. Here at Code Hive Tx, LLC, we aim to work hard
        on your project!
      </li>
      <li>
        The hexagonal honeycomb ⬡ is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeycomb#Geometry">97% optimal</a> in terms
        of
        volume to surface area.
      </li>

    </ol>

    <p>
      We’ve curated some <a href="https://unsplash.com/collections/aT3yHhUkxYk/abejas">bee pictures</a>, which make great
      backgrounds.

      Sorry, we don’t have honey, bees, or hives for sale— but the
      Texas Beekeepers Association can help you find
      <a href="https://texasbeekeepers.org/honey-locator/">Texas honey</a> or
      other information.
